# P.D.'s Text-Kitchen
A repository with an entire suite of text modification tools for creative writers. Get Cooking!! 

#### How to Use this Suite: 
On any one of these sites, you'll be able to use the power of computation to modify a provided text file to remix and play with the language in it. These programs are running basic scripts that can handle hundreds of thousands of words at a time! You may use an open-access pdf to play with the capabilities as you figure out how to make these most useful to you. Here are a couple of possibilities: 

1. Use someone else's text (or a dataset of texts, like all of the tweets by a public figure, or a public document) and mash it up using one of these tools and make new language out of it! 
2. Use one of your own texts and mash it up to explore new ways of configuring the language of the work. 
3. Use any text and get a sense for what's going on underneath the hood (word count, frequency, syntax, length) to learn something new and try it in your own work!
4. Put any text through one tool, then copy the results into a new document and pass that through another. For example, you could reorder a novel's words from last-to-first with the MANIPULATOR, and then use the SHARPS to create a permutational erasure of the new text! 

## Tool 1: SEPARATOR: Strainer / Colander / Sifter / Sieve
#### Eraser Lab
In the eraser lab, you can permutationally erase letters or words. In other words, white-out every 2nd-9th word in a text! 

## Tool 2: SHARPS: Dicer / Chopper / Mandolin / Knives
#### Line Break Lab
In the Line Break Lab, you can select elements that you want to use as a metric to break the line of a poem or text and create anaphora! 

## Tool 3: INVENTORY: Cabinet / Fridge / Grocery List / Drawer
#### Alphabetizer Lab
In the alphabetizer lab, you can either conduct a word frequency experiment or remix the alphabetical mash of words by rearranging a text alphabetically in columns or rows.

## Tool 4: MANIPULATOR: Spatula, Oven Mitt, Slotted Spoon, Ladle 
#### Text Reversal Lab
This tool also plays with the order of a text, but instead of organizing by word, this tool will reverse the order of sentences or clauses, reverse the order of words from front to back, and so on. Do this to get a sense for word associations and sonics! 

## Tool 5: COMBINER: Food Processor / Mixer / Beater / Blender
#### Markov Mashup Lab
In the mashup lab, this Markov model will output statistically-probable sentences based on solely the text that was uploaded. Larger files (plays, novels, corpuses) make this a bit easier to work with and fine-tune!


# If you use this to create a new work… 
You've just created a piece of computer assisted writing! 
The author of this repository, P.D. Edgar, publishes computer-assisted writing at his magazine, _remediatelitmag.xyz_. Consider submitting a process note (the story of what tool you used and how) and the results of your experiments for publication!
